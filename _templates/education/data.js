I became more and more involved in the music department and eventually walked away with a B.A. degree in <strong>music theory</strong>.    <br><br>    I started learning <strong>Java</strong> programming during this time. The emphasis was on basic <strong>data structures</strong> and <strong>sequential data files</strong>. In my free time I was an avid <strong>marimbist</strong> and studied <strong>fencing</strong>."

I dove into <strong>IDL</strong> programming and using <strong>ENVI</strong> software. I also started to teach myself <strong>Python</strong> at this time and how to use it for <strong>ArcGIS</strong> scripts, image processing and many other tasks.    <br><br>    My <em><strong>thesis project</strong></em> was to write software to effectively use a car-mounted panoramic camera (Ladybug3 Spherical Camera) in analyzing landslide imagery. The goal was to use <strong>GPS</strong> and structure-from-motion (<strong>SFM</strong>) techniques to estimate landslide scale from video images and to process multiple videos to make a <strong>time-series</strong> of landslide imagery."

I've completed 7 out of 10 courses and enjoyed them so far but I need to find time between work and two kids to complete the last three."
